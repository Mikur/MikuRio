# MikuRio: The Repository hosting the Course Eval Web Page Code



This repository is a project currently worked on by two UW CSE students. One problem with our current Course Evaluation Catalog is that it is a bare bones, webpage lacking functionality such as searching and comparing. We aim to fix these things by allowing for

	- Searching classes or teachers
	- Organize data to be visually appealing.
	- Display other information such as all teachers who taught the course.

Only UW students can access the data, to prevent publication or distribution of data to non UW students.
